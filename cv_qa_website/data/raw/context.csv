Graduate Program Data at Capgemini Invent;Currently enrolled in the Graduate Program Data at Capgemini Invent, where I am completing three rotations as a Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Strategy Consultant. Engaged in projects in the public sector, developing data quality algorithms and anomaly detection systems, and in the aeronautical industry, developing systems to detect condensation trails using ground and satellite imagery. Developed a regression model and Tableau dashboard for the project. Taught Time Series at Centrale Supelec and for the X/HEC master's program, and Reinforcement Learning for the X/HC master's program. I also worked on setting up an observation system to study and monitor contrails. Enjoys the dynamic team and client interactions, with roles fluctuating between strategy consulting, data science, and data engineering.
Languages and Other Competences;Fluent in French and English, with basic knowledge of German and Spanish. Proficient in technical skills including Python, R, Git, Java, SQL, and Hadoop, with practical experience in tools such as Azure Cloud and Spark. Holds certifications in Cloud Azure AZ900 and has completed various training courses in machine learning and computer science. Also certified in first aid (level 1) and a professional diver (PADI DiveMaster), showcasing a diverse range of skills and interests. Daily use of Python, with experience in MATLAB, R, and Hadoop during studies. Collaborative work involves daily use of Git. 
Associative Commitment at ESSEC and Scuba Diving Association;Actively involved in NOISE (New Observatory for Social and Ecological Innovation) at ESSEC, contributing to discussions with academic teams and organizing the RISE Challenge for solidarity micro-financing. Co-founded a scuba diving association, overcoming challenges such as COVID-19 related cancellations by organizing online talks on marine preservation, showcasing leadership, organizational skills, and a strong commitment to community engagement. Inspired by a similar community in Leeds, the experience required significant investment and skill development, with flexibility demonstrated in navigating challenges. 
Why Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Leeds;I decided to go to Leeds University for a more practical training and a different approach to engineering studies. Mechanical Engineering is the most diverse course in England, ranging from thermodynamics to industrial design. It was also a way for me to experience very different cultures in a new environment.It was also for me a way of discovering very different cultures in a different environment. It was also a way for me to discover very different cultures in a different environment while developing my English. The University of Leeds is also a top-ranking university, especially in mechanical engineering.
Why Master Grande Ecole at ESSEC;I decided to join ESSEC's master in management following an introductory AI course I took at Leeds University. Rather than pursuing research, I wanted to see the business implications of data and AI.  So I joined Essec in part for the Accenture Strategic Business Analytics Chair and its analytical, interpersonal and operational program. I also liked the system of tailor-made courses and the diversity of partnerships and double degrees.
Why Double Degree with Saint-Cyr;I pursued a double degree with Saint Cyr, motivated by my keen interest in the defense sector and a desire to challenge myself. This prestigious and highly selective program admits only five students annually. The program is structured to include six months of intensive military training, during which we are taught a range of skills from basic military tactics to the nuances of leading a section. This is followed by six months of academic study, where we join second-year Saint-Cyrien students at the ESM (Ecole Speciale Militaire).
Why Master of Science in Artificial intelligence at CentraleSupelec;I finished my studies by doing a master of science at Centralesupelec to finish developing technical skills in machine learning, deeplearning, and even AI in the broadest sense. It's one of the masters that covers the widest range of topics around AI, and also allows you to specialize during the second semester by taking courses in a wide variety of subjects, from natural language processing to multi-agent systems. I also appreciated the values espoused by the master's program, which sees AI as a tool for society, favoring research projects in the medical and environmental fields.
Why Scuba Diving Association;I created Plong'ESSEC, the diving association, above all to share my passion and make it accessible to as many students as possible. I was also a member of a diving association at Leeds University, so if you can do it in Leeds I don't see why you can't do it in Cergy, I thought to myself at the time. For me, it's also an activity that raises awareness of the importance of preserving marine biodiversity and the environment.
Why Capgemini Invent Program Data;For me, the Data Program at Capgemini Invent is a way of satisfying my curiosity by doing 3 rotations and increasing my skills in the areas that interest me most from both a business and technical point of view. I also particularly appreciate Capgemini Invent's values: Honesty, Boldness, Trust, Freedom, Fun, Modesty, Team spirit, as well as its environmental involvement. What's more, I've joined a company's practice that is undergoing a major transformation with the acquisition of Quantmetry, which is very exciting.
